# A-Simple-Blockchain
It's about implementing a blockchain peer to peer network to handle a ledger of transactions
collectively. A blockchain is chain of blocks that continually grows as more transactions are
added to the system. Each block references the block preceding it, and once the network agrees
to a block, the transactions included in this block cannot be changed. The state transitions of
this immutable ledger are preserved.


# The network can work in two modes :
  1. proof of work (pow).
  2. practical byzantine fault tolerance (pbft).
